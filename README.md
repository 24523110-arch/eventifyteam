# Eventify — Concert Management System (Revised)

Dark neon purple, glassmorphism concert MIS — revised down to 3 roles with fully functional CRUD, a scrollable splash/login page, and an AI-assisted PDF evaluation report. Built with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Radix UI (shadcn-style components), Framer Motion, Recharts, and Zustand. Backend is Express + PostgreSQL, plus `pdfkit` for report generation.

## Roles & access

| Role | Pages |
|---|---|
| **Manager** | Dashboard, Finance, Reports (AI PDF report), User Management, Settings |
| **Admin / Event Organizer** | Dashboard, Ticket Sales, Vendor Management, Reports (operational), Settings |
| **Security Team** | Dashboard, Live Monitoring, Crowd Monitoring, Incident Center, Settings |

Menus are hidden (not disabled) per role in the sidebar, and routes are guarded client-side via `RoleRoute` — visiting another role's URL directly redirects to your own dashboard. Access is **also enforced server-side**: login issues a JWT, every API request carries it as a Bearer token, and writes are restricted to the owning role (a security user cannot `POST /api/users`, etc.). The session persists across refreshes and is cleared on 401.

Demo accounts (shown on the login screen):
```
manager@eventify.io  / manager123
admin@eventify.io    / admin123
security@eventify.io / security123
```

## What's functional

- **Splash + Login**: scrollable landing hero above a real login form — email format validation, password length validation, role selector, remember me, loading state, inline + banner error messages, redirect to the correct dashboard per role. Auth is checked against PostgreSQL (`POST /api/auth/login`, bcrypt via `pgcrypto`).
- **CRUD (Shadcn-style Dialog + Select, all wired to Zustand stores → REST API → PostgreSQL)**:
  - User Management (Manager) — create, edit, enable/disable, delete, search
  - Vendor Management (Admin) — create, edit, delete, search, status filter
  - Incident Center (Security) — create, edit, delete, search, status actions (Escalate/Resolve/Close) in a detail dialog
- **Notifications**: bell panel opens, mark-as-read, mark-all-as-read, clear all — all persisted.
- **AI Concert Evaluation Report (Manager → Reports)**: pulls ticket/attendance/finance data from the store, calls the backend, which generates a narrative insight (Claude API if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set server-side, else a deterministic local summary), builds a PDF via `pdfkit`, and saves a record to the `reports` table. Full loading state with step progression, success/error toasts, and a working PDF download.
- **Responsive**: sidebar becomes a slide-in drawer on mobile/tablet (`<lg`), all grids collapse to single/double column.
- **Zustand stores**, one per domain: `authStore`, `dashboardStore`, `notificationStore`, `userStore`, `vendorStore`, `incidentStore`, `referenceStore`, `settingsStore`, `toastStore`. Every store hydrates from the Express API on load and pushes CRUD actions back to it — there are no static data files left in the frontend. Even the form dropdown options (role list, security teams, vendor categories) come from the database via `GET /api/reference`.

## What was removed (per "less is more")

Executive/Operations/Venue role split (6 roles → 3), Venue Management dashboard, Alert Center, Gate Monitoring, Sponsor Analytics, Staff Management, System Health — all deleted, not hidden, since none had real functionality and weren't in the revised role scope. Dead Export PDF/Excel/Share buttons that did nothing were removed wherever the AI report feature didn't replace them. The unused `@tanstack/react-table` dependency was removed (the project never actually used it — `DataTable` is hand-rolled).

## Setup

### 1. Database (PostgreSQL)
```bash
# create a database named eventify (adjust to your setup)
createdb eventify
```

### 2. Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # set DATABASE_URL, optionally ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npm run db:migrate          # creates tables + loads seed data
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env        # set VITE_API_BASE_URL if backend runs elsewhere
npm run dev
```

The backend must be running for the app to work now — every module (auth, dashboards, CRUD, notifications, reports) reads from and writes to PostgreSQL through the Express API. See `server/README.md` for the full endpoint list and database details.

## Database schema

See `server/src/db/schema.sql` for the full DDL. Summary:

- `events` — one row per concert (seeded with the Coldplay demo event)
- `app_users` — auth + User Management
- `vendors` — Vendor Management
- `security_teams`, `incidents` — Incident Center
- `role_options`, `vendor_categories` — lookup tables backing the form dropdowns (served via `GET /api/reference`, alongside `security_teams`)
- `crowd_zones`, `density_trend` — Live/Crowd Monitoring
- `notifications`, `activity_feed` — bell panel
- `finance_summary`, `finance_breakdown`, `revenue_trend`, `ticket_summary`, `hourly_sales`, `daily_revenue`, `checkin_conversion` — Finance dashboard + Ticket Sales
- `reports` — persisted AI evaluation reports (PDF stored as base64)

## Known limitations

- Most KPI card "delta" figures (e.g. `+12.4%`) have no historical baseline table yet, so they remain the same illustrative values the dummy data shipped with — the underlying totals they're attached to are live from the database. Exception: the Security "Avg Response Time" KPI and the Incident Center metrics strip are now computed from real incident status-transition timestamps (`acknowledged_at` / `resolved_at`).
- Dependencies could not be installed or the app build-verified against a live PostgreSQL instance in the sandbox this was authored in (no network egress, no root to install PostgreSQL). Every SQL file, JS file (`node --check`), and TypeScript file (`tsc --noEmit`, whole project, zero errors) has been syntax/type-checked; seed data column counts and enum values were cross-checked by hand against the schema. Please run `npm run db:migrate` and `npm run dev` (both `/` and `/server`) locally and report back if anything needs adjusting.
